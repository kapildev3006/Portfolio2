/**
 * @file Firebase Security Rules
 * @description This ruleset implements a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and portfolios,
 * with public read access for projects and contact submissions restricted to authenticated users for writing.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores individual user profiles, only accessible to the owner.
 * - /portfolio/{portfolioId}: Stores main portfolio data, only accessible to the owner.
 * - /projects/{projectId}: Stores individual portfolio projects, publicly readable but write-protected.
 * - /contactSubmissions/{submissionId}: Stores contact form submissions.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own profile data.
 * - Users can only read/write their own portfolio data.
 * - Projects are publicly readable, but only authenticated users with an "adminEmail" matching the portfolio settings can write to it.
 * - Contact submissions are write-protected.
