## Style Guidelines:

- Choose a dark color scheme that suggests depth and sophistication, fitting for a high-end portfolio. Primary color: Vibrant blue (#29ABE2) to draw the eye to the most important content. This is evocative of creativity and clarity.
- Background color: Dark gray (#333333) as a base. This will allow the content to pop.
- Accent color: Teal (#2EE6D6), which is analogous to blue but stands apart due to its greater saturation.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. Space Grotesk offers a tech-aligned look suitable for large text, and Inter brings a neutral, highly legible look that is more appropriate for long text.
- Use minimalistic icons from 'shadcn/ui' to maintain a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Employ a single-page layout with clear section divisions. Use 'Tailwind CSS' grid system for responsive design.
- Subtle transitions and animations using GSAP and Framer Motion on scroll and component mount for a smooth user experience.
